Bug Fix Example
fix: Resolve infinite loop in data fetching

Corrects an issue where the data fetching mechanism would enter an
infinite loop under specific error conditions, causing the application
to freeze. Ensures proper error handling and retry logic.

-------------------------------------------
Refactoring Example
refactor: Extract API calls into dedicated service

Moves all data fetching logic from component files into a new `apiService.js`.
This centralizes API interactions, improves code reusability, and makes
components cleaner and easier to test.
